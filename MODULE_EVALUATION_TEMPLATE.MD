# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## Frontend
* [ ] If provided, End-to-end tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_

  * -_note: read more about current practices at [https://ux.folio.org/docs/all-guidelines/](https://ux.folio.org/docs/all-guidelines/)_
  * e.g. Saving state when navigating between apps (or confirming that you'll lose the state)
* [ ] Must work in the latest version of Chrome (the supported runtime environment) at the time of evaluation

## Backend
* [ ] Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor
  * -_note: read more at https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/okapi-core/src/main/raml/ModuleDescriptor.json_
* [ ] Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor
  * -_note: read more at [https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683)_
* [ ] If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section
* [ ] All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI
* [ ] All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.
  * -_note: read more at https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/naming-conventions/ and https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Permission+Set+Guidelines_
* [ ] Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value
* [ ] If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_

* [ ] The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public
* [ ] The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header

  * Possible red flags:
    * Connection affinity / sticky sessions / etc. are used
