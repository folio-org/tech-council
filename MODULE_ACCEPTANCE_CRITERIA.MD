# FOLIO Module Acceptance Values and Criteria

## version 3.0 (ratified 2025-01-25)

## Overview
The Technical Council (TC) has defined a process for technical evaluation of modules for inclusion in a FOLIO release.  This document outlines the high level values and specific criteria used when evaluating modules as part of this process.  The distinction between values and criteria is as follows:

* **Values** are high-level factors that are unlikely to change over time.  They should be understandable even to a non-technical audience.
* **Criteria** are specific, verifiable tests as to how we’re meeting the Values within the current state of affairs.  Criteria will evolve over time to respond to changes in the Project’s technology stack, current best practices, etc. They may require a degree of technical expertise or domain knowledge to fully understand.

In some cases, we may not yet have comprehensive Criteria for assessing a module’s adherence to a Value.  In such cases, subjective review and analysis will be applied, and may lead to discussion.

This document provides the criteria against which a module will be assessed for inclusion into a FOLIO release, following the [New Module Technical Evaluation Process](NEW_MODULE_TECH_EVAL.MD). 

Existing FOLIO modules ideally conform to the same Values and Criteria.  It is understood that not all existing modules currently do so, especially modules created before the Values & Criteria were initially defined.  The Technical Council will work with development teams to align the current reality of the code with the Values and Criteria over time, as practicable.  Such processes will need to be developed and documented.

Please see [Before Development](NEW_MODULE_TECH_EVAL.MD#before-development) for any planned development to new or existing modules that may intentionally diverge from these Values or Criteria.

## How to use this document

When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD-{module name}.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17-mod-foo.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

Replace the title with the name of the module or library.

Remove either the Frontend or the Backend section.

Use these conventions to indicate the status of each criterion.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

* [ ] Must not depend on a FOLIO library that has not been approved through the TCR process
* [ ] Gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration. (3, 5, 12)

### Backend

Note: Backend criteria apply to modules, shared backend libraries, and edge modules.

* [ ] The module doesn’t access data in DB schemas other than its own and public. Exception: [FOLIO Query Machine](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TC/pages/852852742/0011-Folio+Query+Machine+FQM) and its modules are the mechanism through which we provide read access across DB storage boundaries.
