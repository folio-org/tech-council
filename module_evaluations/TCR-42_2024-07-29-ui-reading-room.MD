## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD-{module name}.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17-mod-foo.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## TCR Process Improvements
[_Please include here any suggestions that you feel might improve the TCR Processes._]
- For new reviewers more detailed instructions about license and accessibility checking might be helpful
- PC approval  still ambiguous. Can we approve this without it?
