# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## [Criteria](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/7b10294a5c1c10c7e1a7c5b9f99f04bf07630f06/MODULE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.MD)

## Shared/Common
* [x] Uses Apache 2.0 license
* [x] Module build MUST produce a valid module descriptor
* [x] Module descriptor MUST include interface requirements for all consumed APIs
* [x] Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
* [x] ~Installation documentation is included~
* [x] Personal data form is completed, accurate, and provided as `PERSONAL_DATA_DISCLOSURE.md` file
* [x] Sensitive and environment-specific information is not checked into git repository
* [x] Module is written in a language and framework from the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) page
* [x] Module only uses FOLIO interfaces already provided by previously accepted modules
  * `servint` appears to have been introduced in early 2021, before the module acceptance process was in place. This feels more like "this is an exception" rather than "this is acceptable".
* [x] Module gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration
* [x] Sonarqube hasn't identified any security issues, major code smells or excessive (>3%) duplication
* [x] Uses [officially supported](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) build tools
* [x] Unit tests have 80% coverage or greater, and are based on [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)

## Frontend
* [x] ~If provided, End-to-end tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)~
* [x] Have i18n support via react-intl and an `en.json` file with English texts
* [x] Have WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as measured by a current major version of axe DevTools Chrome Extension
* [x] Use the latest release of Stripes at the time of evaluation
  * Instead of "latest release" should we use the "officially supported technologies list"?
* [x] Follow relevant existing UI layouts, patterns and norms
* [x] Must work in the latest version of Chrome (the supported runtime environment) at the time of evaluation

## Backend
* [x] ~Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor~
  * -_note: read more at https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/okapi-core/src/main/raml/ModuleDescriptor.json_
* [x] ~Module includes executable implementations of all endpoints in the provides section of the Module Descriptor~
* [x] ~Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor~
  * -_note: read more at [https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683)_
* [x] ~If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section~
* [x] ~All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI~
* [x] ~All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.~
  * -_note: read more at https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/naming-conventions/ and https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Permission+Set+Guidelines_
* [x] ~Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value~
* [x] ~If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)~
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_
  * -_note: these tests are defined in https://github.com/folio-org/folio-integration-tests_
* [x] ~Data is segregated by tenant at the storage layer~
* [x] ~The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public~
* [x] ~The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header~
* [x] ~Standard GET `/admin/health` endpoint returning a 200 response~
  * -_note: read more at https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Back+End+Module+Health+Check+Protocol_
* [x] ~High Availability (HA) compliant~
  * Possible red flags:
    * Connection affinity / sticky sessions / etc. are used
    * Local container storage is used
    * Services are stateful
* [x] ~Module only uses infrastructure / platform technologies on the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) list.~
  * _e.g. PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, etc._

## TCR Process Improvements
[_Please include here any suggestions that you feel might improve the TCR Processes._]
* I am increasingly strongly uncomfortable evaluating license compatibility. I suggest we change the line
> Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
to
> Includes a report of the licenses used by third-party dependencies
and we can delegate evaluation of that list to a person/body with appropriate credentials for this kind of thing. IOW, IANAL and I really really don't want to be responsible for making definitive statements about license compatibility. Example tools in NPM-land:
  * npx apache2-license-checker
  * license-checker
 * Do we/should we have a Source Of Record for application documentation? Is it OK to link to the wiki or should apps point to https://docs.folio.org/?
