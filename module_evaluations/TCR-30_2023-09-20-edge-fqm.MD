# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## [Criteria](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/7b10294a5c1c10c7e1a7c5b9f99f04bf07630f06/MODULE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.MD)

## Shared/Common
* [x] Uses Apache 2.0 license
* [x] Module build MUST produce a valid module descriptor
* [x] Module descriptor MUST include interface requirements for all consumed APIs
* [x] Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
* [x] Installation documentation is included
  * Installation documentation exists but is brief.
  * Documentation references external module (edge-common) for details, which could change independently of this project.
* [x] Personal data form is completed, accurate, and provided as `PERSONAL_DATA_DISCLOSURE.md` file
* [x] Sensitive and environment-specific information is not checked into git repository
* [x] Module is written in a language and framework from the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) page
* [ ] Module only uses FOLIO interfaces already provided by previously accepted modules _e.g. a UI module cannot be accepted that relies on an interface only provided by a back end module that hasn't been accepted yet_
  * This depends on `mod-fqm-manager` for which `edge-fqm` is the edge module of and the `mod-fqm-manager` module is not yet approved as of this review.
* [x] Module gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration
* [x] Sonarqube hasn't identified any security issues, major code smells or excessive (>3%) duplication
  * No major issues reported by Sonarqube, but Sonarcube is also reporting "No Coverage information (61.9% Estimated after merge)".
* [x] Uses [officially supported](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) build tools
  * This uses unit tests related dependencies not on the supported technologies list, such as com.squareup.okhttp3.mockwebserver.
  * The list of technologies does not go into details on such dependencies.
* [x] Unit tests have 80% coverage or greater, and are based on [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * ~The Coverage is only at 61.9% according to Sonarcube.~
  * As of commit hash [adae385241c928f79c9723a5f7039ade3fefc903](https://github.com/folio-org/edge-fqm/commit/adae385241c928f79c9723a5f7039ade3fefc903) the test coverage reported is 93.7%.
  * This uses test related dependencies not on the supported technologies list, such as com.squareup.okhttp3.mockwebserver.

## Frontend
* [x] ~If provided, End-to-end tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)~
* [x] ~Have i18n support via react-intl and an `en.json` file with English texts~
* [x] ~Have WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as measured by a current major version of axe DevTools Chrome Extension~
* [x] ~Use the latest release of Stripes at the time of evaluation~
* [x] ~Follow relevant existing UI layouts, patterns and norms~
* [x] ~Must work in the latest version of Chrome (the supported runtime environment) at the time of evaluation~

## Backend
* [x] Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor
* [x] ~Module includes executable implementations of all endpoints in the provides section of the Module Descriptor~
* [x] Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor
* [x] ~If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section~
* [ ] All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI
  * Only `/entity-types` is showing up in the build-time generated API and SDK Documentation.
  * The following endpoints are missing: `/query`.
  * The `edge-fqm.yaml` does not have references to `/query` but `@FeignClient` is used and references the `/query` endpoints in `QueryClient` and `QueryController` (using `@RestCintroller`).
* [x] ~All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.~
* [x] ~Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value~
* [x] If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * This uses test related dependencies not on the supported technologies list, such as com.squareup.okhttp3.mockwebserver.
* [x] ~Data is segregated by tenant at the storage layer~
* [x] ~The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public~
* [x] ~The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header~
* [x] Standard GET `/admin/health` endpoint returning a 200 response
* [x] High Availability (HA) compliant
* [x] Module only uses infrastructure / platform technologies on the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) list.
