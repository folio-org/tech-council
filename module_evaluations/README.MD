## Purpose
This directory contains evaluation results.

## Conventions
Evalution results should be:
 * Based off [the module evaluation template](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/master/MODULE_EVALUATION_TEMPLATE).
 * Named as follows: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`
   - The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date which the evaluation results file was created.  

## About
More information about the new module technical evaluation process can be found [here](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/master/NEW_MODULE_TECH_EVAL.MD)
