# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## [Criteria](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/7b10294a5c1c10c7e1a7c5b9f99f04bf07630f06/MODULE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.MD)

## Shared/Common
* [x] Uses Apache 2.0 license
* [x] Module build MUST produce a valid module descriptor
* [x] Module descriptor MUST include interface requirements for all consumed APIs
* [x] Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
  * Direct dependencies:
    * [x] github.com/MikeTaylor/catlogger v0.0.2 uses Apache 2.0
    * [x] github.com/google/uuid v1.4.0 uses  BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License](https://github.com/google/uuid/blob/master/LICENSE), which [we expect to be whitelisted](https://folio-project.slack.com/archives/CAQ7L02PP/p1701694102115289)
    * [x] github.com/indexdata/foliogo v0.1.5 uses Apache 2.0
    * [x] github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.5.0 uses MIT Licence
  * Indirect dependencies:
    * [x] github.com/jackc/pgpassfile v1.0.0 uses MIT Licence
    * [x] github.com/jackc/pgservicefile v0.0.0-20221227161230-091c0ba34f0a uses MIT Licence
    * [x] github.com/jackc/puddle/v2 v2.2.1 uses MIT Licence
    * [x] github.com/smartystreets/goconvey v1.8.1 uses MIT Licence
    * [x] golang.org/x/crypto v0.9.0 uses BSD-3-Clause
    * [x] golang.org/x/sync v0.1.0 uses BSD-3-Clause
    * [x] golang.org/x/text v0.9.0 uses BSD-3-Clause
    * [x] moul.io/http2curl v1.0.0 uses Apache 2.0 or MIT Licence as we prefer
  * Summary: this requirement is met provided because the BSD-3-Clause and MIT licences are Apache-2.0-compatible
* [x] Installation documentation is included
  * in README: https://github.com/folio-org/mod-reporting
* [x] Personal data form is completed, accurate, and provided as `PERSONAL_DATA_DISCLOSURE.md` file
* [x] Sensitive and environment-specific information is not checked into git repository
* [ ] Module is written in a language and framework from the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) page
* [x] Module only uses FOLIO interfaces already provided by previously accepted modules _e.g. a UI module cannot be accepted that relies on an interface only provided by a back end module that hasn't been accepted yet_
  * uses "settings:1.0" of mod-settings
* [x] Module gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~ Sonarqube hasn't identified any security issues, major code smells or excessive (>3%) duplication
  * The code does not go through Sonarqube, but is vetted by six separate code-style tools, see https://github.com/folio-org/.github/blob/master/README-go-lint.md
* [ ] Uses [officially supported](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) build tools
* [x] Unit tests have 80% coverage or greater, and are based on [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * Go line coverage is 430/518 = 83%, see https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=org.folio%3Amod-reporting&metric=coverage&view=list
  * It fails the officially appoved technologies criterium but this results from failing the language criterium above.

## Backend
* [x] Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor
  * https://github.com/folio-org/mod-reporting/blame/main/descriptors/ModuleDescriptor-template.json
* [x] Module includes executable implementations of all endpoints in the provides section of the Module Descriptor
* [x] Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor
* [x] If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section
* [x] All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI
* [x] All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.
  * -_note: read more at https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/naming-conventions/ and https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Permission+Set+Guidelines_
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~ Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~ If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_
  * -_note: these tests are defined in https://github.com/folio-org/folio-integration-tests_
* [x] Data is segregated by tenant at the storage layer
* [x] The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public
* [x] The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header
* [x] Standard GET `/admin/health` endpoint returning a 200 response
  * -_note: read more at https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Back+End+Module+Health+Check+Protocol_
* [x] High Availability (HA) compliant
  * Possible red flags:
    * Connection affinity / sticky sessions / etc. are used
    * Local container storage is used
    * Services are stateful
* [x] Module only uses infrastructure / platform technologies on the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) list.
  * uses PostgreSQL

## TCR Process Improvements
* Expand criterium for consumed APIs; mention requires/okapiInterfaces/...: https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/pull/75
* Use ASF 3rd Party License Policy for module evaluation: https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/pull/79
