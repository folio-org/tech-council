# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## [Criteria](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/7b10294a5c1c10c7e1a7c5b9f99f04bf07630f06/MODULE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.MD)

## Shared/Common
* [x] Uses Apache 2.0 license
* [x] Module build MUST produce a valid module descriptor
* [x] Module descriptor MUST include interface requirements for all consumed APIs
* [x] Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
* [x] Installation documentation is included
  * -_Note: See https://github.com/folio-org/mod-lists/blob/master/README.md_
* [x] Personal data form is completed, accurate, and provided as `PERSONAL_DATA_DISCLOSURE.md` file
* [x] Sensitive and environment-specific information is not checked into git repository
* [x] Module is written in a language and framework from the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) page
* [ ] Module only uses FOLIO interfaces already provided by previously accepted modules _e.g. a UI module cannot be accepted that relies on an interface only provided by a back end module that hasn't been accepted yet_
  * _Note: requires mod-fqm-manager which is also under evaluation_
* [x] Module gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration
  * _Note: Tested various permutations of omitted and/or bogus S3/MinIO environment variables.  All were handled gracefully by the module._
* [ ] Sonarqube hasn't identified any security issues, major code smells or excessive (>3%) duplication
  * _Note: There are 7 major code smells.  They are all related to Exception classes having 6 parents which is greater than 5 authorized.  I would personally give this a pass but it's something we'll need to discuss with the TC.  See [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=org.folio%3Amod-lists)._ 
* [x] Uses [officially supported](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) build tools
* [x] Unit tests have 80% coverage or greater, and are based on [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)


## Backend
* [x] Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor
  * -_note: read more at https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/okapi-core/src/main/raml/ModuleDescriptor.json_
* [X] Module includes executable implementations of all endpoints in the provides section of the Module Descriptor
  * Note: all endpoints in descriptor have entries in `list.yaml`, all `operationId` values listed in `list.yaml` have corresponding methods with matching arguments in `ListController.java`, `ListExportController.java`, and `ListConfigurationController.java`.
* [x] Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor
  * -_note: read more at [https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683)_
* [x] If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section
* [x] All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI
* [x] All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.
  * -_note: read more at https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/naming-conventions/ and https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Permission+Set+Guidelines_
* [x] ~Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value~
* [x] ~If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)~
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_
  * -_note: these tests are defined in https://github.com/folio-org/folio-integration-tests_
* [x] Data is segregated by tenant at the storage layer
* [x] The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public
  * From the self-eval:
    * FQM's DB schema reaches into other schemas (for the same tenant) via views, however these views isolate the app itself from accessing other schemas so that it doesn't access other schemas directly. The views also allow us to quickly account for external schemas without code changes.
    * Additionally, these views are intended to be used only on DB read replicas, in order to prevent it from negatively impacting read/write DB performance for other modules.
    * Also, there are alternatives to the DB views, which may be used if implemented, such as harvesting data via Kafka events and putting the results into tables with the same schemas as the views, or connecting the DB to a data warehouse DB and pointing the views at that
* [x] The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header
* [x] Standard GET `/admin/health` endpoint returning a 200 response
  * -_note: read more at https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Back+End+Module+Health+Check+Protocol_
  * -_note: yes, via actuator_
* [x] High Availability (HA) compliant
  * Possible red flags:
    * Connection affinity / sticky sessions / etc. are used
    * Local container storage is used
    * Services are stateful
* [ ] Module only uses infrastructure / platform technologies on the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) list.
  * _e.g. PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, etc._
  * -_note: need to discuss with the TC whether or not MinIO should be on the the OST list_

## TCR Process Improvements
* Consider adding lombok to the Officially Supported Technologies list since it is used extensively througout the project, despite NOT having an Apache 2.0 license.  This could help evaluators in the future.
* Consider adjusting the sonarqube rule about number of levels of inheritence allowed (currently 5)
* Consider adding MinIO to the Offiicially Supported Technologies list, and approving the decision here: https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=96419874
* It would be helpful to have the module name, possibly other metadata listed at the top of this form
