# Module acceptance criteria template

## How to use this form
When performing a technical evaluation of a module, create a copy of this document and use the conventions below to indicate the status of each criterion.  The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/tree/master/module_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD.MD`, e.g. `TCR-1_2021-11-17.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.

* [x] ACCEPTABLE
* [x] ~INAPPLICABLE~
* [ ] UNACCEPTABLE
  * comments on what was evaluated/not evaluated, why a criterion failed

## [Criteria](https://github.com/folio-org/tech-council/blob/7b10294a5c1c10c7e1a7c5b9f99f04bf07630f06/MODULE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.MD)

## Shared/Common
* [x] Uses Apache 2.0 license
* CM [ ] Module build MUST produce a valid module descriptor
* CM [x] Module descriptor MUST include interface requirements for all consumed APIs
  * _Note: no `required` or `optional` interfaces are listed in the ModuleDescriptor.json, but the module requires mod-fqm-manager to work. From the [module descriptor for mod-fqm-manager](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-fqm-manager/blob/63cd20e91a7b418e0ff38608588d0cb4eb0a3ef0/descriptors/ModuleDescriptor-template.json), no Web API interfaces are published, so all communication must be via Kafka. This fits our requirements, but does not document the implicit dependencies._
* CM [x] Third party dependencies use an Apache 2.0 compatible license
  * I _think_ the below are fine, but need confirmation:
  * [Project Lombok license](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/blob/master/LICENSE) is not Apache 2.0, but seems compatible.
  * [Testcontainers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/main/LICENSE)  uses MIT license
* [x] Installation documentation is included
  * -_Note: See https://github.com/folio-org/mod-lists/blob/master/README.md_
* CM [ ] Personal data form is completed, accurate, and provided as `PERSONAL_DATA_DISCLOSURE.md` file
  * _Note: mod-lists processess PII, but does not seem to store anywhere, just sends to `ui-lists`._
* CM [x] Sensitive and environment-specific information is not checked into git repository
  * _Note: I've given a best look for obvious things, but should have extra eyes on this._
* CM [x] Module is written in a language and framework from the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) page
  * _Note: my only question is whether Lombok needs official approval._
* CM [ ] Module only uses FOLIO interfaces already provided by previously accepted modules _e.g. a UI module cannot be accepted that relies on an interface only provided by a back end module that hasn't been accepted yet_
* [ ] Module gracefully handles the absence of third party systems or related configuration
* CM [ ] Sonarqube hasn't identified any security issues, major code smells or excessive (>3%) duplication
* CM [x] Uses [officially supported](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) build tools
  * _Note: my only question is whether Lombok needs official approval (not immediately clear to me whether it's used as a framework or in the build process)_
* CM [ ] Unit tests have 80% coverage or greater, and are based on [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)

## Backend
* [x] Module's repository includes a compliant Module Descriptor
  * -_note: read more at https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/okapi-core/src/main/raml/ModuleDescriptor.json_
* [ ] Module includes executable implementations of all endpoints in the provides section of the Module Descriptor
* [x] Environment vars are documented in the ModuleDescriptor
  * -_note: read more at [https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683](https://wiki.folio.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65110683)_
* [ ] If a module provides interfaces intended to be consumed by other FOLIO Modules, they must be defined in the Module Descriptor "provides" section
* [ ] All API endpoints are documented in RAML or OpenAPI
* [ ] All API endpoints protected with appropriate permissions as per the following guidelines and recommendations, e.g. avoid using `*.all` permissions, all necessary module permissions are assigned, etc.
  * -_note: read more at https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/naming-conventions/ and https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Permission+Set+Guidelines_
* [ ] Module provides reference data (if applicable), e.g. if there is a controlled vocabulary where the module requires at least one value
* [ ] If provided, integration (API) tests must be written in an [officially approved technology](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies)
  * -_note: while it's strongly recommended that modules implement integration tests, it's not a requirement_
  * -_note: these tests are defined in https://github.com/folio-org/folio-integration-tests_
* [ ] Data is segregated by tenant at the storage layer
* [ ] The module doesn't access data in DB schemas other than its own and public
* [ ] The module responds with a tenant's content based on x-okapi-tenant header
* [ ] Standard GET `/admin/health` endpoint returning a 200 response
  * -_note: read more at https://wiki.folio.org/display/DD/Back+End+Module+Health+Check+Protocol_
* [ ] High Availability (HA) compliant
  * Possible red flags:
    * Connection affinity / sticky sessions / etc. are used
    * Local container storage is used
    * Services are stateful
* [ ] Module only uses infrastructure / platform technologies on the [officially approved technologies](https://wiki.folio.org/display/TC/Officially+Supported+Technologies) list.
  * _e.g. PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, etc._
